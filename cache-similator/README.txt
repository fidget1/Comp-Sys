Cache lab assignment

Code Guidelines

I did not rely on any special coding guidelines, as I'm using PyCharm, and all guidelines are built in. I chose Python
(3.8) because OOP with initialization methods seemed well suited to creating a cache in terms of ease of implementation
and design.

References

The following scripts were used as references, to see how other people had done things such as parsing arguments, and
the ADTs chosen for the project. I ultimately determined that ADTs such as Memory were not necessary for this
assignment.

Running the code

Unfortunately I am getting "No module named wmucachelab" if I try to run my code from the commandline, but it does run
as a project in PyCharm. I have not been able to determine the reason. It appears that the parent folder is specified
by my IDE. Please do due diligence with running the program if you have issues because in my IDE, I am passing all
tests. (See below for why I am unable to test on CS servers.)

I created a run/debug configuration where I specified parameters and ran the code. You should simply have to set Python
3.8 and it should run.

Note

I was unable to test my code on CS servers. I emailed the CS admins the last week of September as well as today and they
have not responded.
